# wedding-invitation

This was a simple project for a friend to invite his friends to his wedding. I used a Firebase realtime db to track attendence and guests.

It also used Google Maps API to show the location of the meet.


This website was hosted on a school server that I had access to at the time. In case my access has been removed, I've added photos of the project.
